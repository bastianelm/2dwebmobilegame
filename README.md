Gamedescription: It's a multiplayer underwatter plattformer about a shark eating little fishes to geht fat and strong, but it's getting slower, too, if it eats to much. So be careful! Also be aware of the humans in the game, who are diving into the sea to visit you. Of course, you can start an attack, too by swimming up and smashing there boats. Divers can only dive for a short time, if you destroy their airtanks!

Technologies: Vanilla JS, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Firebase

Some pseudocode to get some idea about how the code will look in future (this is just thought as preview/demo not even an alpha version only pseudocode)

gameState = true
while(gameState)
  play game
...

play game = new Game(player, difficulty, etc as JSON-Object)

switch(difficulty)
  case 'easy'
    do stuff


etc
